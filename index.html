  <p>PROSE AND POEMS OF<br>
    AVI GABRIELLE BEN PANSENSOY<br><br>
    Poems written by a poetic soul rooted from diverse genres are displayed explicitly in different sections to convey the desire of illuminating the poems produced by the rhythm of an emotion.<br><br>
    Literature is the barometer for the measurement of the degree of the civilization of a particular society,prose and poetry are its two common forms.Prose is a work of art of a writer, which contains sentences and paragraphs, and does not have any metrical structure.While a poetry is the inner expression of a poet written with rhyme.The basic difference between prose and poetry is that we have sentences and paragraphs, whereas lines and stanzas can be found in a poetry. Further, there is regular writing in prose written randomly, but there is a unique style of writing a poetry.We can find prose in newspaper articles, blogs, short stories, etc., however, poetry is used to share something special, aesthetically.Along the development of human societies across the globe, prose and poetry evolved into different genres as an expression of the soul of a society.<br><br>
    After the outbreak of world war two, a new poetic movement was developed called DADA, it rejected reason and logic in writing poems because poems belong into the realm of human emotion.It was founded in Zurich,Switzerland on 1916 based on the nihilistic human intuition which provoked literary revolutions, political revolutions and paved the way for SURREALISM founded on MARXISM.Surrealism is an artistic method of combining realities and imaginations to create a work of art as if produced by dreams.The movement is influenced heavily by Freudian Psycho - Analysis, it synthesizes the irreconcilable contradictions of the conscious and unconscious minds through the creation of revolutionary poems filled with bizarre stanzas.

  <p>DEFINITION, ESSENCE, FOLLOW ME, FORGOTTEN AND MY PRISON are the first five  love poems displayed conspicuously across the first section of the page as collective expression of desire combined with despair, accompanied with bizarre emotion rooted from surreal thoughts and traversing along the path of a thorny journey towards the realm of the mundane promises of love meant to be broken.<br><br>
    Love,yes that Love is a complictated term which is the most abused word in the history of mankind.But, it is the sweetest infliction of pain fused with betrayal; condimented with the ingredients jealousy that is stewed for quite so long within the cauldron of forgiveness.<br><br>
    “I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where. I love you simply, without problems or pride: I love you in this way because I do not know any other way of loving but this, in which there is no I or you, so intimate that your hand upon my chest is my hand, so intimate that when I fall asleep your eyes close.” <br><br>
― Pablo Neruda, 100 Love Sonnets

<div class = "define">
  <p>DEFINITION<br><br>
    Where your beautiful soul slips,<br>
in hologram within my brain cells,<br>
like a viscous gel that flows,<br>
on the river of wet dreams,<br>
attached with pink cotton balls,<br>
on plastered mosaic's walls.<br><br>

It's a blast from atomic flares,<br>
creeping through the nucleus of my veins,<br>
where the radioactive isotopes,<br>
wake the dead umbilical cords,<br>
the chill of pleasured radiation falls,<br>
into a sticky path to a celestial bliss.<br><br>

But everything is a wild imagination,<br>
produced by a devastating hallucination,<br>
though floats on the waves of fascination,<br>
somehow is a prized soulful creation.<br><br>

you are very beautiful: Your definition.<br><br>
</p>
</div>

<div class = "ess">

<p>ESSENCE<br><br>
Perfumed red water melon, sweet juices flow: Your chest protrudes, <br>
They arouse, seduce my sleeping craving: Imagination floats, <br><br>

Your body's curve is sensuous, pulverizes in me within, <br>
its fragmented beauty is a mosaic in my brain, <br>
soul of mine dares to dive into the pool of sin.<br><br>

And you allowed me to delve beyond infatuation,<br>
with a bullet train in constant saturation, <br>
towards your emotional happiness, our final destination.<br><br>

Woman! let me caress your heart in every hue, <br>
with me my dearest love to follow you.<br><br>

On a mattress created by hallucination, <br>
let our interwoven bodies travel in fascination, <br>
and free ourselves from tradition.<br><br>

Sweat scented woman, molten virginal crayon drips: Pure, <br>
coated our love a passionated heat: It will long endure. <br><br>
</p>
</div>

<div class = "follow">
<p>FOLLOW ME <br><br>
Follow me, <br>
where the river runs in silence, <br>
with the blooming lavender orchids, <br>
under the canopy of vined trees, <br>
decorated by hanging violet flowers, <br>
let our flesh explore the senses of pleasure.<br><br>

Deep into the forest and perfumed grasses, <br>
wet black leather on your skin, <br>
under the heavy full moon, <br>
let our imaginations run wild, <br>
our bodies seeking each others' fires,<br>
and taste the carnal pleasure<br>
we never dreamt of.<br><br>

I want to hold you tighter, <br>
caress every part of you, <br>
dive into your senses, <br>
and go home crazier than before.<br><br>

If one day you will gonna leave, <br>
leave me still loving you, <br>
with love letters sealed in my drawer, <br>
but always remember, <br>
you will remain an immortal being in
my heart. <br><br>

<div class ="forgotten">
<p>FORGOTTEN<br><br>
Forgotten love, rotten in a dark sepulcher, <br>
Forsaken, trashed over the roaring river, <br>
Formalined beneath the graveyard forever, <br>
But the flame of fornicated sweet memories, <br>
Burns and constantly reappears through memory's pages, <br>
Bursts with intense desire for long french kisses.<br><br>

Oh! Forgotten love, obliterated with magnetic,<br>
Oblivion, this swollen heart pumps lunatic,<br>
Obscene pain, stolen obscure memories of tragic,<br>
Separation, the love of mine bleeds hemorrhagic,<br>
Sentimental tears, ceaseless, soul turns frantic, <br>
Secluded in scorching solitude, life becomes seismic. <br><br>

<div class = "prison">
  <p>MY PRISON<br><br>
I couldn't change anymore to satisfy yourself, <br>
I live this life, happy being myself.<br><br>

You really are done with me, <br>
leaving me frustrated before the sea.<br><br>

Tonight, I'm totally lost, <br>
shivering under the December's frost.<br><br>

You've got a heart, harder than a cold stone, <br>
and I'm quivering, frozen, drier than a bone.<br><br>

My heart over your palm is manipulated, <br>
with the sharpest blade, it is lacerated.<br><br>

I gave everything, my emotion, they're all wasted.<br>
but the memory of you, within me is forever pasted.<br><br>

With barrels of beers at the corner of a room, <br>
all alone, broken in tears, waiting for a sonic boom.<br><br>

your love is a poisonous poison, <br>
i'm starving for it all the time, that's my prison.<br><br>

Yet everything is gone, gone, and wasted, <br>
my life, love and soul, all of them are wasted. <br><br>

My senses, still infected by your kisses,<br>

Such a sweet poison, this tongue craves,<br>

Memories of them, flow through the veins,<br>

So this heart is intoxicated and so my nerves.<br><br>



Your lips contain highly addictive sweet juices,<br>

Yet, am always wanting them like lost pieces,<br>

<div class = "econ">
  <p>It is an unambiguous depiction of the sad political and economic reality that has gripped  the Filipino society with the chain of repressive poverty.The votes of the Filipinos are being bought by the politicians during election and consequently if these politicians will be catapulted into power then corruption will just be a normal reality.The Philippines has the Government labeled as one of the most corrupt bureaucracies across the globe, the Jews took 2000 years of wandering before regaining back Israel in 1948 and they are dying to defend the country to prevent another holocaust.While in the Philippines, Filipino politicians such as Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, Rodrigo Duterte have been selling their country piece by piece to the the Chinese in exchange of billions of pesos of kickbacks.The saddest part of it is that only few Filipino are defending the country from the betrayal of their politicians.<br><br>
    It must be true that spanish colonialism must also be considered as one of the culprits of the current poverty due to the fact that the Spanish colonizers taught the Filipinos  to obey the colonial masters without question but they never taught them good education on how to develop a society.However, the Spaniards had given up this country for so long and it is not quite sane to blame still the Spaniards but the Filipinos must look within and should revolt against the staus-quo that has been oppressing them.For instance, the officials occupying the bureaucracy have been borrowing large amount of money from the international financial powers, instead of utilizing the money for the development of infrastructures for the welfare of the people; but the borrowed money crawled straight into the bank accounts of the corrupt politicians.<br><br>
    The late President Ferdinand Marcos best exemplified as the most corrupt politician who stole billions  of dollars from the national coffer of the this country,the Filipino people are still paying for the loans that he borrowed from the International Monetary bank(IMF - WB); the most painful truth is that he was still given a hero's burial.<br><br>
    Currently under the administration of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte, the government opted to borrow money from China with higher rates of interest compared to the Japanese with lower rates of interest; it is not so surprising since the officials are not really up there to protect the interests of the people but to enrich themselves through massive kickbacks.<br><br>
    WHAT REALLY ARE THE CAUSES OF POVERTY IN THE PHILIPINES?<br><br>
    Some said that the culprit of poverty of every Filipino is indolence, it should be valid but the root causes must be considered to determine a more credible response.The Filipino society is led by the landed elites and businessmen who themselves are occuppying the highest bureaucratic positions, when the Filipinos demand for lands to till hey ended up being murdered because they are going against the interests of these landlords who of course are the congressmen, mayors, governors or even the senators.It should be an abnormal reality if these landlords will give in into the demands of the poor peasants otherwise they will be canonized as the modern saints of the Vatican,just most recently;there were extra judicial murders in the island of Negros because the landlords with the law enforcement agencies under their thumbs can easily order the slaughter of the poor peasants than giving them lands to cultivate for their subsistence.Due to the lack of opportunities brought by landlessness, poor farmers are pushed by hunger to go into the urban areas for a greener pasteur but most of them ended up as homeless souls and worst they resort into criminal activities for existence.This is also one of the root causes of a higher rate of prostitution as well as rampant illicit drug trade since these people are forced by the reality to be into these dangerous activities.<br><br>
    The elites are pushing for the implemetation of death penalty but they never thought that these poor people are forced to be criminals due to joblessness, death penalty is not the answer for the social problems that all of the Fiipinos are confronting but to address the root causes of poverty to establish a peaceful society.Furthermore, ordinary workers in the Philippines, comprising the majority of the population; are considered to be the poorest sould due to a very low salary equivalent to slavery.The salary below subsistence level provokes the rapid spread of slum areas where malignant diseases are killing infants and adults alike due to poor sanitary services from the Government, and most of these slum areas are considered to be dangerous places where murders are just daily occurrences due to human nature to survive at the expense of the other individuals.<br><br>
    Hunger echoes into the minimum wage earners since their wages are too low too keep pace with inflation rate pegged at 6 % that they could barely eat twice a day, if the workers demand for a higher salary to live decently; their cadavers end up in garbage bins because the Government labels them as Communists.Truly, if the poor people feed their fellow poor people they are considered to be saints but if they question the reasons of their poverty then they will be considered as insurgents.The workers' collective demand for a decent salary to enable them to send their children to school and live like human beings could never be met because the owners of the companies are the politicians themselves or those proprietors with closest connection with the politicians.As a result, the workers' salary remains in perpetual below the existence level that only a bloody revolution can save them from poverty where a society will be established founded on social justice.A society where true democracy is upheld where humans live equally with the others and economic discrimination is abolished for the good of all.<br><br>
    I have been believing not so long ago that our OFW's (Overseas Filipino Workers) are the true heroes of this country but when I visited once the Libingan Ng Mga Bayani, I found no OFW being buried there but a thief called Ferdinand Marcos. That propaganda is nothin but an outright lie.<br><br>
    I am not really a necro-monger, again; I visited  a public cemetery. My sight kept on gazing into the written R.I.P. on the dead people's crosses, some were inscribed so cute and some are mesmerizing with colorful colors of black and violet.Why R.I.P.(Rest In Peace) when it should be written the other way around?it should be written K.B.H. as Killed By Hunger, M.B.C. as Murdered By Contractualization or S.B.D.D.S. as Slaughtered By Duterte Diehard Supporters.

  <p>Scarecrow<br><br>

Innocent child,<br>
wake up from your rainbow colored dreams,<br>
listen to the red feathered rooster,<br>
it crows the early dawn's burden,<br>
hang on me,<br>
dance along with the swaying golden weeds,<br>
among the fields of corn,<br>
watch the trees of blue and gray,<br>
follow me on the dikes of rice fields of amber green,<br>
look at the scarecrow,<br>
it looks like death,<br>
open up your eyes to the sad realities,<br>
the common farmer of tattered clothes,<br>
his pockets filled with mud,<br>
he is a prisoner of a violent semi-feudalism,<br>
with hands wrapped in callous,<br>
bleeding while tilling the bone-dry land,<br>
he works like a slave for his landlord.<br><br>
Little child,<br>
even the plain smells with fog,<br>
moistened leaves keep on falling over your head,<br>
but never close your eyes,<br>
do not be scared to see the toiling man's stomach,<br>
it has been empty for ages,<br>
he is nailed on the cross of ferocious poverty,<br>
dying,<br>
suffering,<br>
yet our politicians live in luxury,<br>
do nothing but to corrupt for eternal power,<br>
they keep on pretending as common farmer's saviors,<br>
but they are actually scarecrows,<br>
the angels of death,<br>
do not trust even you admire them with sugar-coated words,<br>
sooner they will give you the worst blow.<br><br>
sweet child,<br>
open up your mind to the relentless cruelties of this world,<br>
the common farmer's skin is burning,<br>
still toiling under the hell of the sun,<br>
sweating with blood,<br>
and his eyes are flowing with tears of agony,<br>
yet the government does nothing to give him a decent life,<br>
he goes to church every sunday morning,<br>
confessing everything about liberation,<br>
asking for freedom from the madness of hunger,<br>
but he realizes not,<br>
people around him,<br>
including laymen,<br>
also are victims of brutal political corruption.<br>

  <p>DECADENCE<br><br>

So it is the most awaited confrontation,<br>

so very controversial speech of retribution,<br>

so these eyes see a national laceration,<br>

so the youthful dreams crawl on the path of deterioration.<br><br>



This is decivilization, louder on radio station,<br>

this is degradation, louder on television,<br>

this is an epitaph for social degeneration,<br>

this is a eulogy but everybody feasts with fascination.<br><br>



For days and years their hatred<br>

suckled anger, thoughts filled<br>

with perverted contempt, in the end<br>

balloon perforated and exploded.<br><br>



And our senate, as media deified,<br>

it's the house of jesters yet applauded,<br>

where character assassinations are promoted,<br>

ignorant spectators laughed and respected,<br>

finally, them without knowing, a country is trampled.<br>

lungs infected by porcupined phlegm,<br>
stung with the sharpest pin of hell,<br>
poisoned with fanged ideological gale,<br>
and the bloody intestine in hunger fell.<br><br>

The innocence of molten soul,<br>
melting with hardened ice cream of fire, <br>
raped by denuded intelligence with a mole,<br>
its neck tied in political strategy,<br>
hidden in vacuum colored wet promises,<br>
and the stomach suffers the fragrance of corrupt diarrhea.<br><br>

Till you feel nauseated,<br>
totally dehydrated, <br>
your vote-selling mind caused you pain,<br>
your pocket is totally drained,<br>
your face swells oyster's mucus, <br>
the future of yours constipates dysmenorrhea,<br>

  <p>SOUND OF PLUNDER<br><br>

There is a song on broken streets,<br>

     since the overthrow of a thief in 1986,<br>
      corruption is once again glorified,<br>
       it's the name of the game in the house of representatives and the senate,<br>
        everybody wants to plunder,<br>
         from ordinary men to the highest officials,<br>
          everybody wants to get richer overnight,<br>
           disdaining decency every night.<br><br>

Watch the morning show,<br>
 from Umagang Kay Ganda to Unang Hirit,<br>
  listen to that loud music,<br>
   it is not the concert of Megadeth,<br>
   but it goes through your spines,<br>
    ex PGMA and JLN are guilty of tax robbery,<br>
     mothers who taught their children of stealing,<br>
      they simply break the lyrics of social morality,<br>
       the scumbags of our homes.<br><br>

 just drifting into the nightmare of our history,<br>
